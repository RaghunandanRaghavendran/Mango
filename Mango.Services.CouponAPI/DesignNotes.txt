Coupon Services are only meant for the simple CRUD operation of providing the Coupons

Design

1. Created the ASP Net WEBAPI project with .Net 7.0 and disabled the https type because there was an error in importing 
   the certificates, the application port also changed for 7001.
2. Added the packages for entity framework, automapper, SQL and EntityFrameworkCore, Please refer to the packages by rightclick 
   on the project and check the Edit Project files for the dependencies
3. Added the Models and DTOs, it has simple 4 props for CouponId, Code, Discout price and MaxAmount
4. Added the ApplicationDBContext and defined the property for the Coupons
5. Added the section for SQL in Program.cs and added the configuration in appSettings.json
6. Started migrations for creating the Tables and Db
7. Added RegisterMaps for mapping the CouponDto and Coupon Model props
8. AutoMapper is added in Program.cs so that it can be used as a dependecy injection anywhere in the project
          IMapper mapper = MappingConfig.RegisterMaps().CreateMapper();
          builder.Services.AddSingleton(mapper);
          builder.Services.AddAutoMapper(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies());
9. Defined the Controller for CRUD operations.
10. To have the consistent Response, we defined the Model ResponseType (ResponseDTO as per the course) which has Result, 
    Message and IsSuccess
11. Changed the Controller methods to return the ActionResult<ResponseType> and wrap the response inside the Result 
    property of the ResponseType
