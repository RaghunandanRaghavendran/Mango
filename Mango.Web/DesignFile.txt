Design

Created the ASP.NET Web project with MVC type, Which gave the HomeController by default and a working UI application

Section 1 : Consuming the Coupon API

A. Created the Models for CouponDTO, RequestType and ResponseType
    a. ResponseType - Result, Message, IsSucceess
    b. RequestType
        public ApiType ApiType { get; set; } = ApiType.GET;
        public string Url { get; set; }
        public object Data { get; set; }
        public string AccessToken { get; set; }

    c. CouponDTO - Same props used in API

B. Created the Service and IService folders
    a. BaseService and IBaseService - It defines a method SendAsync which makes the generalized method for API call
       SendAsync
         - It uses the dependecy of HttpClientFactory which can make http calls
         - HttpRequestMessage which will include the headers, Urls, Contents needs to be filled for Post request 
         - make the call: SendAsync(message) (Message was the object of HttpRequestMessage) SendAsyc is part of HttpClientFactory
         - Capture the respose and return the ResponseType
    b. CouponService and ICouponService - It defines the method for CRUD operations, please refer to the implementation
    c. Registered the Coupons and Base services in Program.cs
            builder.Services.AddHttpContextAccessor();
            builder.Services.AddHttpClient();
            builder.Services.AddHttpClient<ICouponService, CouponService>();
            StaticDetails.CouponAPIBase = builder.Configuration["ServiceUrls:CouponAPI"];

            builder.Services.AddScoped<ICouponService, CouponService>();
            builder.Services.AddScoped<IBaseService, BaseService>();

C. Build the project and make sure UI project is working

F. Added the Dropdown to show the Coupons section - Dropdown is taken from Bootstap nav dropdown
        <li class="nav-item dropdown">
                            <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle text-white" href="#" id="navbarDropdown" role="button" data-bs-toggle="dropdown" aria-expanded="false">

                            <ul class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="navbarDropdown">
                                <li><a class="dropdown-item" asp-controller="Coupon" asp-action="CouponIndex">Coupon</a></li>
                                <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Another action</a></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
